### N.b.

This hack was first assembled using the OpenCore getting started guide. Using a bonkers ig-platform-id at least got the install up and running, debugging the frame buffer issues was done by booting into a live USB burned with Linux Mint and then editing the EFI from there (I'd recommend a persistent partition for this sort of "rescue USB", otherwise your tools will vanish between each boot).

For the frame buffer patch described in the getting started guide to work, **I had to enable CSM in my BIOS** (I've read that enabling "Both BIOS and UEFI" will work as well). Otherwise, I would get a garbled screen, as if the frame buffer didn't get enough memory. I had dismissed the guide's memory patch because of that garbled screen effect and instead had decided to go through and try to boot with *every* Broadwell laptop platform id, each resulting in a kernel panic of course. In the end, it's using the recommended platform id, adding the frame buffer patches from the guide and enabling CSM that works.
